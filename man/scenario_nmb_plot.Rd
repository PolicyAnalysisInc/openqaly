\title{Plot Scenario Net Monetary Benefit as Bar Chart}
\usage{
scenario_nmb_plot(
  results,
  health_outcome,
  cost_outcome,
  groups = "overall",
  wtp = NULL,
  interventions = NULL,
  comparators = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly scenario results object (output from run_scenario)}

\item{health_outcome}{Name of the health outcome summary (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_outcome}{Name of the cost summary (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), specific group name, or vector}

\item{wtp}{Optional override for willingness-to-pay. If NULL, extracts from outcome metadata.}

\item{interventions}{Character vector of intervention strategy name(s).
At least one of interventions or comparators must be specified.}

\item{comparators}{Character vector of comparator strategy name(s).
At least one of interventions or comparators must be specified.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a horizontal bar chart showing the incremental Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)
for each scenario. NMB = (Difference in Outcomes × WTP) - Difference in Costs.
}
\details{
NMB calculations always use discounted values as this is a cost-effectiveness measure.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
results <- run_scenario(model)

# NMB bar chart (comparator perspective)
scenario_nmb_plot(results, "total_qalys", "total_cost", comparators = "control")

# NMB with explicit WTP
scenario_nmb_plot(results, "total_qalys", "total_cost",
                  interventions = "treatment", wtp = 50000)
}
