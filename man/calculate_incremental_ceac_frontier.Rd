\title{Calculate Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Frontier}
\usage{
calculate_incremental_ceac_frontier(
  results,
  outcome_summary,
  cost_summary,
  wtp = seq(0, 1e+05, by = 5000),
  group = "aggregated",
  strategies = NULL,
  discounted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly PSA results object (from run_psa)}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{wtp}{Numeric vector of WTP thresholds to evaluate. Default is
seq(0, 100000, by = 5000)}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default) uses aggregated results,
specific group name filters to that group, NULL or "all" includes all groups
(triggers separate calculations per group)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
  \item{wtp}{Willingness-to-pay threshold}
  \item{optimal_strategy}{Strategy with highest expected NMB}
  \item{probability}{Probability that optimal strategy is best}
  \item{expected_nmb}{Expected NMB of optimal strategy}
  \item{group}{Group name (if applicable)}
}
\description{
Identifies which strategy has the highest expected net monetary benefit
at each willingness-to-pay threshold in a multi-way (incremental) comparison.
}
\details{
The incremental CE acceptability frontier shows which strategy would be
chosen at each WTP threshold based on expected (mean) NMB across simulations
in a multi-way comparison. It also provides the probability that this optimal
choice is actually the best.

When multiple groups are present, the optimal strategy is identified separately
for each group, and the group column identifies which group each result
corresponds to.
