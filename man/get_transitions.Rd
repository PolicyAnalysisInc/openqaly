\title{Extract Transition Data from Model Results}
\usage{
get_transitions(
  results,
  format = c("long", "wide"),
  collapsed = TRUE,
  strategies = NULL,
  groups = "overall",
  from_states = NULL,
  to_states = NULL,
  cycles = NULL,
  time_unit = c("cycle", "day", "week", "month", "year"),
  use_display_names = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{format}{Output format: "long" (one row per cycle x from_state x to_state)
or "wide" (one row per cycle, from->to pairs as columns)}

\item{collapsed}{Logical. If TRUE (default), use collapsed state names.
If FALSE, use expanded state names (tunnel states).}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{groups}{Group selection:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"overall"} - Overall population (default, uses first group's transitions)
  \item \code{"group_name"} - Specific group by name
  \item \code{c("group1", "group2")} - Multiple specific groups
  \item \code{c("overall", "group1")} - Specific groups + overall
  \item \code{"all"} or \code{NULL} - All groups + overall
  \item \code{"all_groups"} - All groups without overall
}}

\item{from_states}{Character vector of from-state names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{to_states}{Character vector of to-state names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{cycles}{Integer vector of cycles to include (NULL for all)}

\item{time_unit}{Time unit for output: "cycle" (default), "day", "week", "month", "year"}

\item{use_display_names}{Logical. If TRUE (default), use display names for entities}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns depending on format:
  \itemize{
    \item Long: strategy, group, cycle, [time_unit], from_state, to_state, probability
    \item Wide: strategy, group, cycle, [time_unit], from->to pair columns
  }
}
\description{
Extracts conditional transition probabilities from model results into
data frames suitable for visualization and export. Transition data is
available per-segment (not aggregated), so when \code{groups = "overall"},
transitions are taken from the first group's segment for each strategy
(transition probabilities are identical across groups since formulas
don't depend on group).

\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "openqaly"))
results <- run_model(model)

# Get long format transition data
trans_long <- get_transitions(results, format = "long")

# Get transitions for specific cycle
trans_c1 <- get_transitions(results, cycles = 1)

# Get wide format
trans_wide <- get_transitions(results, format = "wide")
}
