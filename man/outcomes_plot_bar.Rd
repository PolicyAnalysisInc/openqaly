\arguments{
\item{res}{A heRomod2 model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{outcome}{Name of the outcome summary to plot (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default), specific group name, or NULL}

\item{strategy_name_field}{Field to use for strategy names: "name" or "display_name"}

\item{group_name_field}{Field to use for group names: "name" or "display_name"}

\item{value_name_field}{Field to use for value component names}

\item{summary_name_field}{Field to use for the outcome label}

\item{referent}{Single reference strategy for intervention perspective (e.g., "new_treatment").
If provided, shows referent - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with comparator.}

\item{comparator}{Single reference strategy for comparator perspective (e.g., "control").
If provided, shows intervention - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with referent.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a bar chart showing outcome values by value component and strategy.
Can display absolute values or differences between strategies.
}
\details{
When neither referent nor comparator is specified, shows absolute outcome values.

When referent is specified (intervention perspective):
- Creates N-1 comparisons showing (referent - each_other_strategy)
- Example with 3 strategies {A, B, C} and referent=A: shows "A vs. B" and "A vs. C"

When comparator is specified (comparator perspective):
- Creates N-1 comparisons showing (each_other_strategy - comparator)
- Example with 3 strategies {A, B, C} and comparator=C: shows "A vs. C" and "B vs. C"
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "heRomod2"))
results <- run_model(model)

# Absolute outcome values
outcomes_plot_bar(results, "total_qalys")

# Differences vs control (comparator perspective)
outcomes_plot_bar(results, "total_qalys", comparator = "control")

# New treatment vs others (intervention perspective)
outcomes_plot_bar(results, "total_qalys", referent = "new_treatment")
}
