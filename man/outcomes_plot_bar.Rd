\usage{
outcomes_plot_bar(
  res,
  outcome,
  groups = "overall",
  strategies = NULL,
  interventions = NULL,
  comparators = NULL,
  value_labels = TRUE,
  label_accuracy = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A openqaly model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{outcome}{Name of the outcome summary to plot (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{groups}{Which groups to include in the plot. By default, the overall population (weighted average over all groups) is shown. Other options include 'all_groups' (displays results for each group separately), 'all' (displays results for each group and overall), or a character vector of specific group names}

\item{strategies}{Strategies to include (when plotting absolute values).}

\item{interventions}{Strategies used as interventions (when plotting differences)}

\item{comparators}{Strategies used as commparators (when plotting differences)}

\item{value_labels}{Logical. If TRUE (default), display numeric value labels at bar edges.}

\item{label_accuracy}{Numeric. Precision for label formatting via `scales::comma()`. Default is 0.01.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a bar chart showing outcome values by value component and strategy.
Can display absolute values or differences between strategies.
}
\details{
Whether absolute values or differences are shown, which strategies are included, and the direction of comparisons depends on which of the `strategies`, `interventions`, or `comparators` arguments are provided:
1. (Default) Absolute values for specified strategies. Use `strategies` argument to specify which strategies to include.
2. When passing a single strategy to `interventions`, shows different between that strategy and other comparators. Use `comparators` argument to specify which strategies to compare against.
3. When passing a single strategy to `comparators`, shows difference other strategies and the comparator. Use `interventions` argument to specify which strategies will be compared against comparator.

Models containing multiple groups

\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "openqaly"))
results <- run_model(model)

# Absolute outcome values
outcomes_plot_bar(results, "total_qalys")

# Differences vs control (comparator perspective)
outcomes_plot_bar(results, "total_qalys", comparators = "control")

# New treatment vs others (intervention perspective)
outcomes_plot_bar(results, "total_qalys", interventions = "new_treatment")
