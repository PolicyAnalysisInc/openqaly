\title{Check if ICER is Flipped (SW Quadrant)}
\usage{
is_flipped_icer(icer_value)

is_flipped_icer(icer_value)
}
\arguments{
\item{icer_value}{Numeric ICER value}
}
\value{
Logical TRUE if ICER is finite and negative

Logical TRUE if ICER is flipped (negative)
}
\description{
Internal helper to determine if an ICER represents a "flipped" comparison
(comparator more costly and more effective, resulting in negative ICER).

Internal helper to check if an ICER value represents a flipped comparison
(SW quadrant - comparator is more costly & more effective than intervention).
For tables, asterisk should appear when ICER differs from REQUESTED direction,
which is indicated by negative ICER values in our encoding.
