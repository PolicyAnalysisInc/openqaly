\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly PSA results object, or pre-calculated CEAC data
from calculate_incremental_ceac()}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary (required if results is
a model object)}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary (required if results is a
model object)}

\item{intervention}{Reference strategy for comparison (intervention perspective: A vs. B, A vs. C).
Mutually exclusive with comparator.}

\item{comparator}{Reference strategy for comparison (comparator perspective: B vs. A, C vs. A).
Mutually exclusive with intervention.}

\item{wtp_range}{Numeric vector with min and max WTP values for x-axis.
Default is c(0, 100000)}

\item{wtp_step}{Step size for WTP thresholds. Default is 5000}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default) uses overall/aggregated results,
"all" includes overall + all groups, "all_groups" includes all groups without overall,
specific group name(s) filter to those groups (triggers faceting by group)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{title}{Plot title. If NULL, auto-generated}

\item{xlab}{X-axis label. Default is "Willingness to Pay"}

\item{ylab}{Y-axis label. Default is "Probability of Being Most Cost-Effective"}

\item{legend_position}{Legend position: "bottom" (default), "right", "top",
"left", or "none"}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a line plot showing the probability from pairwise comparisons at
different WTP thresholds.
}
\details{
Pairwise comparisons calculate P(intervention > comparator) for each pair.
The plot displays these probabilities across different WTP thresholds.

\strong{Intervention mode}: Shows P(intervention > each other strategy)

\strong{Comparator mode}: Shows P(each other strategy > comparator)

A probability > 0.5 indicates higher likelihood of being cost-effective
in the comparison.

CEAC calculations always use discounted values as this is a cost-effectiveness measure.
