\usage{
calculate_pairwise_ceac(
  results,
  outcome_summary,
  cost_summary,
  intervention = NULL,
  comparator = NULL,
  wtp = seq(0, 1e+05, by = 5000),
  group = "aggregated",
  strategies = NULL,
  discounted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A heRomod2 PSA results object (from run_psa)}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{intervention}{Reference strategy for comparison (intervention perspective: A vs. B, A vs. C).
Mutually exclusive with comparator.}

\item{comparator}{Reference strategy for comparison (comparator perspective: B vs. A, C vs. A).
Mutually exclusive with intervention.}

\item{wtp}{Numeric vector of WTP thresholds to evaluate. Default is
seq(0, 100000, by = 5000)}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default) uses aggregated results,
specific group name filters to that group, NULL or "all" includes all groups
(triggers separate calculations per group)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
  \item{wtp}{Willingness-to-pay threshold}
  \item{strategy}{Strategy being compared}
  \item{probability}{Probability based on comparison direction}
  \item{group}{Group name (if applicable)}
  \item{comparator}{Reference strategy name}
}
\description{
Calculates the probability that one strategy is more cost-effective than
another at different WTP thresholds.
}
\details{
Pairwise comparisons calculate P(intervention > comparator) for each pair.
The comparison direction is determined by which parameter is used:

\strong{Intervention mode} (intervention = 'A'): A is the intervention in all comparisons
- Calculates P(A > B), P(A > C), etc.
- Output rows show other strategies as comparators

\strong{Comparator mode} (comparator = 'A'): A is the comparator in all comparisons
- Calculates P(B > A), P(C > A), etc.
- Output rows show other strategies as interventions

The function accepts both technical names (e.g., "treatment_a") and display
names (e.g., "Treatment A") for the fixed strategy.
