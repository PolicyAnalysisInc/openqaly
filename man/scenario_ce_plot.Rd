\title{Plot Scenario Cost-Effectiveness (ICER) as Bar Chart}
\usage{
scenario_ce_plot(
  results,
  health_outcome,
  cost_outcome,
  groups = "overall",
  interventions = NULL,
  comparators = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly scenario results object (output from run_scenario)}

\item{health_outcome}{Name of the health outcome summary (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_outcome}{Name of the cost summary (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), specific group name, or vector}

\item{interventions}{Character vector of intervention strategy name(s).
At least one of interventions or comparators must be specified.}

\item{comparators}{Character vector of comparator strategy name(s).
At least one of interventions or comparators must be specified.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a horizontal bar chart showing the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)
for each scenario. Handles edge cases: Dominated (more costly, less effective),
Dominant (less costly, more effective), and Equivalent (same costs and outcomes).
}
\details{
ICER = (Cost_intervention - Cost_comparator) / (Outcome_intervention - Outcome_comparator)

Special cases:
- Dominated: Intervention is more costly and less effective (shown as arrow to right)
- Dominant: Intervention is less costly and more effective (ICER = 0 or negative)
- Equivalent: Identical outcomes result in undefined ICER (shown as text)

ICER calculations always use discounted values.
