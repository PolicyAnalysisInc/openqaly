\title{Multinomial distribution}
\usage{
multinomial(size, prob)
}
\arguments{
\item{size}{Number of trials (usually 1 for categorical sampling)}

\item{prob}{Probability vector (must sum to 1)}
}
\value{
Function that takes n (number of samples) and returns n × k matrix
}
\description{
The `multinomial` function can be used to sample categorical outcomes.
Each sample is a vector of counts for each category.
Commonly used with size=1 to sample a single category (one-hot encoded).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Sample initial health state (one of 3 states)
dist_fn <- multinomial(size = 1, prob = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5))
samples <- dist_fn(1000)  # 1000 × 3 matrix of 0s and 1s
}
