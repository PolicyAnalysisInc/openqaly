\arguments{
\item{res}{A heRomod2 model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default), specific group name, or NULL}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategies to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}

\item{strategy_name_field}{Field to use for strategy names: "name", "display_name", or "abbreviation" (default: "display_name")}

\item{group_name_field}{Field to use for group names: "name" or "display_name" (default: "display_name")}

\item{summary_name_field}{Field to use for summary labels: "name" or "display_name" (default: "display_name")}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a cost-effectiveness plane showing all strategies as points with line
segments connecting strategies on the efficiency frontier.
}
\details{
The cost-effectiveness plane plots outcome (x-axis) vs. cost (y-axis).
Strategies on the efficiency frontier are connected with line segments.
Dominated and extended dominated strategies are shown with different styling.

When \code{group = NULL}, creates faceted plots for each group and aggregated results.

\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "heRomod2"))
results <- run_model(model)

# CE frontier for aggregated population
incremental_ce_plot(results, "total_qalys", "total_cost")

# For all groups with faceting
incremental_ce_plot(results, "total_qalys", "total_cost", group = NULL)
}
