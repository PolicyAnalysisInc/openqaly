\usage{
incremental_ce_plot(
  res,
  outcome_summary,
  cost_summary,
  groups = "overall",
  strategies = NULL,
  discounted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A openqaly model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), specific group name, vector of groups, or NULL}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategies to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a cost-effectiveness plane showing all strategies as points with line
segments connecting strategies on the efficiency frontier.
}
\details{
The cost-effectiveness plane plots outcome (x-axis) vs. cost (y-axis).
Strategies on the efficiency frontier are connected with line segments.
Dominated and extended dominated strategies are shown with different styling.

When \code{group = NULL}, creates faceted plots for each group and aggregated results.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "openqaly"))
results <- run_model(model)

# CE frontier for aggregated population
incremental_ce_plot(results, "total_qalys", "total_cost")

# For all groups with faceting
incremental_ce_plot(results, "total_qalys", "total_cost", group = NULL)
}
