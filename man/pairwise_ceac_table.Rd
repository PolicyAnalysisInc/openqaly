}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly PSA results object}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary}

\item{interventions}{Reference strategies for comparison (intervention perspective).
Can be a single strategy or vector of strategies.}

\item{comparators}{Reference strategies for comparison (comparator perspective).
Can be a single strategy or vector of strategies.}

\item{wtp_thresholds}{Numeric vector of WTP thresholds to show as columns.
Default is c(0, 20000, 50000, 100000)}

\item{groups}{Group selection:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"overall"} - Overall population (aggregated, default)
  \item \code{"group_name"} - Specific group by name
  \item \code{c("group1", "group2")} - Multiple specific groups (no overall)
  \item \code{c("overall", "group1")} - Specific groups + overall
  \item \code{"all"} or \code{NULL} - All groups + overall
  \item \code{"all_groups"} - All groups without overall
}}

\item{decimals}{Number of decimal places for percentages (default: 1)}

\item{font_size}{Font size for rendering (default: 11)}

\item{table_format}{Character. Backend to use: "kable" (default) or "flextable"}
}
\value{
A table object (flextable or kable depending on table_format)
}
\description{
Creates a table showing probabilities from pairwise comparisons at selected
willingness-to-pay thresholds.
}
\details{
Pairwise comparisons calculate P(intervention > comparator) for each pair.
The table displays these probabilities at selected WTP thresholds.

At least one of interventions or comparators must be provided. If both are
provided, N×M explicit comparisons are generated.

A probability > 50% indicates higher likelihood of being cost-effective
in the comparison.

CEAC calculations always use discounted values as this is a cost-effectiveness measure.

When multiple groups are present, the table includes a group column showing
results in a hierarchical structure (group -> strategy -> probabilities).

model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "openqaly"))

# Comparator perspective: Compare strategies to control

# Intervention perspective: Compare new treatment to others

                    interventions = "new_treatment")

# Custom WTP thresholds
