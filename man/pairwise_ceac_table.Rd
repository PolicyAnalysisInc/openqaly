\usage{
pairwise_ceac_table(
  results,
  outcome_summary,
  cost_summary,
  intervention = NULL,
  comparator = NULL,
  wtp_thresholds = c(0, 20000, 50000, 1e+05),

}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly PSA results object}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary}

\item{intervention}{Reference strategy for comparison (intervention perspective: A vs. B, A vs. C).
Mutually exclusive with comparator.}

\item{comparator}{Reference strategy for comparison (comparator perspective: B vs. A, C vs. A).
Mutually exclusive with intervention.}

\item{wtp_thresholds}{Numeric vector of WTP thresholds to show as columns.
Default is c(0, 20000, 50000, 100000)}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default) uses aggregated results,
specific group name filters to that group, NULL or "all" includes all groups
(creates hierarchical table with group column)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategies to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values?}

\item{decimals}{Number of decimal places for percentages (default: 1)}

\item{font_size}{Font size for rendering (default: 11)}

\item{table_format}{Character. Backend to use: "kable" (default) or "flextable"}
}
\value{
A table object (flextable or kable depending on table_format)
}
\description{
Creates a table showing probabilities from pairwise comparisons at selected
willingness-to-pay thresholds.
}
\details{
Pairwise comparisons calculate P(intervention > comparator) for each pair.
The table displays these probabilities at selected WTP thresholds.

\strong{Intervention mode}: Shows P(intervention > each other strategy)

\strong{Comparator mode}: Shows P(each other strategy > comparator)

A probability > 50% indicates higher likelihood of being cost-effective
in the comparison.

When multiple groups are present, the table includes a group column showing
results in a hierarchical structure (group → strategy → probabilities).
