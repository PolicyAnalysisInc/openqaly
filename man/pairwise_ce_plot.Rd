\arguments{
\item{res}{A openqaly model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), specific group name, vector of groups, or NULL (all groups + aggregated)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}

\item{intervention}{Single reference strategy for intervention perspective (e.g., "new_treatment").
If provided, shows intervention - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with comparator.}

\item{comparator}{Single reference strategy for comparator perspective (e.g., "control").
If provided, shows intervention - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with intervention.}

\item{strategy_name_field}{Field to use for strategy names: "name", "display_name", or "abbreviation" (default: "display_name")}

\item{group_name_field}{Field to use for group names: "name" or "display_name" (default: "display_name")}

\item{summary_name_field}{Field to use for summary labels: "name" or "display_name" (default: "display_name")}

\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a cost-effectiveness plane showing pairwise comparisons against a single
reference strategy. Uses delta axes (incremental cost vs. incremental outcome)
with the reference strategy at the origin.
}
\details{
The cost-effectiveness plane plots incremental outcome (x-axis) vs. incremental cost (y-axis).
The origin (0,0) represents the reference strategy.

When comparator is specified:
- All other strategies are plotted as points showing their incremental values vs. comparator
- Lines connect origin to each point, with slope representing ICER
- Single plot (or faceted by group if group=NULL)

When intervention is specified:
- Each comparison gets its own facet panel showing intervention vs. one other strategy
- One point per panel at the intervention's incremental position
- Line shows ICER slope from origin
- If group=NULL: uses facet_grid with group on rows, comparison on columns

# Pairwise CE plane vs control (comparator perspective)

# New treatment vs others (intervention perspective)

# For all groups
