\arguments{
\item{results}{A heRomod2 PSA results object, or pre-calculated CEAC data
from calculate_incremental_ceac()}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary (required if results is
a model object)}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary (required if results is a
model object)}

\item{wtp_range}{Numeric vector with min and max WTP values for x-axis.
Default is c(0, 100000)}

\item{wtp_step}{Step size for WTP thresholds. Default is 5000}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default) uses aggregated results,
specific group name filters to that group, NULL or "all" includes all groups
(triggers faceting by group)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}

\item{show_probability}{Logical. Show probability as line thickness or
transparency? Default is FALSE}

\item{title}{Plot title. If NULL, auto-generated}

\item{xlab}{X-axis label. Default is "Willingness to Pay"}

\item{ylab}{Y-axis label. Default is "Probability of Being Most Cost-Effective"}

\item{legend_position}{Legend position: "bottom" (default), "right", "top",
"left", or "none"}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a plot showing which strategy is optimal (highest expected NMB)
at each willingness-to-pay threshold in a multi-way (incremental) comparison,
along with the probability that it is actually the best choice.
}
\details{
The incremental CE acceptability frontier shows the optimal strategy choice
based on expected net monetary benefit at each WTP threshold in a multi-way
comparison. Vertical lines or shaded regions indicate where the optimal
strategy changes.

When multiple groups are present, the plot is automatically faceted by group
using \code{facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "fixed")}.
