\arguments{
\item{results}{A heRomod2 PSA results object, or pre-calculated CEAC data
from calculate_incremental_ceac()}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary (required if results is
a model object)}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary (required if results is a
model object)}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default) uses aggregated results,
specific group name filters to that group, NULL or "all" includes all groups
(triggers faceting by group)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}

\item{show_means}{Logical. Show mean values as larger points? Default is TRUE}

\item{alpha}{Transparency of scatter points (0-1). Default is 0.3}

\item{title}{Plot title. If NULL, auto-generated}

\item{xlab}{X-axis label. Default is "Willingness to Pay"}

\item{ylab}{Y-axis label. Default is "Probability of Being Most Cost-Effective"}

\item{legend_position}{Legend position: "bottom" (default), "right", "top",
"left", or "none"}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a scatter plot showing the distribution of costs and outcomes
from PSA simulations. Each point represents one simulation, colored by strategy.
}
\details{
The scatter plot shows each PSA simulation as a point, colored by strategy.
Mean values for each strategy are shown as larger, highlighted points to
indicate the central tendency of the distribution.

\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "heRomod2"))
psa_results <- run_psa(model, n_sim = 1000)

# Basic scatter plot
psa_scatter_plot(psa_results, "total_qalys", "total_cost")

# Without mean points
psa_scatter_plot(psa_results, "total_qalys", "total_cost", show_means = FALSE)
}
