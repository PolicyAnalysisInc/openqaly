\title{Calculate Discount Factors}
\usage{
calculate_discount_factors(n_cycles, discount_rate, cycle_length_years = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_cycles}{Number of cycles}

\item{discount_rate}{Annual discount rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.035 for 3.5\%)}

\item{cycle_length_years}{Length of each cycle in years (e.g., 1/12 for monthly, 1/52 for weekly)}
}
\value{
Vector of discount factors for each cycle
}
\description{
Calculate discount factors for each cycle using the formula 1/(1+r)^t,
where t is the time in years from the start of the model.
The first cycle (t=0) has a discount factor of 1 (no discounting).
