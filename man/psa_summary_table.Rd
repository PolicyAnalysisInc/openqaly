}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A heRomod2 PSA results object}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary}

\item{pce_wtp}{Numeric vector of WTP thresholds for P(CE) rows
(default: c(50000, 100000, 150000))}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default), specific group, or NULL}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategies to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values?}

\item{outcome_decimals}{Number of decimal places for outcomes (default: 2)}

\item{cost_decimals}{Number of decimal places for costs (default: 0, nearest unit)}

\item{font_size}{Font size for rendering (default: 11)}

\item{table_format}{Character. Backend to use: "kable" (default) or "flextable"}
}
\value{
A table object (flextable or kable depending on table_format)
}
\description{
Creates a table showing summary statistics from PSA simulations including
mean, SD, median (IQR), range, and probability of being cost-effective at
multiple WTP thresholds. Table is transposed with strategies as columns and
statistics as rows.
}
\details{
The table is transposed with strategies as columns. Rows are organized into
three sections:
\itemize{
  \item Outcome: Mean (95% CI), SD, Median (IQR), Range
  \item Cost: Mean (95% CI), SD, Median (IQR), Range
  \item Probability of Cost-Effectiveness: One row per WTP threshold
}

All rounding uses decimal places (not significant figures). Costs are rounded
to the nearest unit by default (cost_decimals = 0).

\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "heRomod2"))
psa_results <- run_psa(model, n_sim = 1000)

# PSA summary table with default WTP thresholds
psa_summary_table(psa_results, "total_qalys", "total_cost")

# Custom WTP thresholds
psa_summary_table(psa_results, "total_qalys", "total_cost",
                  pce_wtp = c(30000, 50000, 100000, 150000))

# Different decimal places

                  outcome_decimals = 3, cost_decimals = 2)
