\title{Extract DSA Summary Values}
\usage{
extract_dsa_summaries(
  results,
  summary_name,
  value_type = c("all", "cost", "outcome"),
  groups = "overall",
  strategies = NULL,
  interventions = NULL,
  comparators = NULL,
  discounted = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{DSA results object from run_dsa()}

\item{summary_name}{Name of the summary to extract (e.g., "total_qalys", "total_cost")}

\item{value_type}{Type of value: "all", "cost", or "outcome"}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), "all" (overall + all groups),
"all_groups" (all groups without overall), or specific group name(s)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all).
Mutually exclusive with interventions/comparators.}

\item{interventions}{Character vector of intervention strategy name(s). Used with
comparators to determine which strategies to extract. When both interventions and
comparators are specified, only those strategies are extracted. When only interventions
is specified, all strategies are extracted (for "interventions vs all others" comparisons).}

\item{comparators}{Character vector of comparator strategy name(s). Used with
interventions to determine which strategies to extract. When both interventions and
comparators are specified, only those strategies are extracted. When only comparators
is specified, all strategies are extracted (for "all others vs comparators" comparisons).}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: run_id, strategy, group, parameter,
  parameter_display_name, variation, amount
}
\description{
Helper function to extract summary values from DSA results across all runs.
Efficiently extracts summaries without processing full trace data, similar to
extract_psa_summaries but for DSA run_id dimension.
