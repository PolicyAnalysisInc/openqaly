\title{Plot Net Monetary Benefit Over Time}
\usage{
nmb_plot_line(
  res,
  health_outcome,
  cost_outcome,
  groups = "overall",
  wtp = NULL,
  interventions = NULL,
  comparators = NULL,
  time_unit = "cycle",
  cumulative = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A openqaly model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{health_outcome}{Name of the health outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_outcome}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), specific group name, vector of groups, or NULL}

\item{wtp}{Optional override for willingness-to-pay. If NULL, extracts from outcome summary metadata.}

\item{interventions}{Character vector of intervention strategies (e.g., "new_treatment").
If provided, shows intervention - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with comparators.}

\item{comparators}{Character vector of comparator strategies (e.g., "control").
If provided, shows intervention - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with interventions.}

\item{time_unit}{Time unit for x-axis: "cycle" (default), "day", "week", "month", "year"}

\item{cumulative}{Logical. If TRUE (default), shows cumulative NMB over time.
If FALSE, shows per-cycle NMB.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a line chart showing cumulative or per-cycle Net Monetary Benefit over time.
}
\details{
Either `interventions` or `comparators` must be specified (one is mandatory).

NMB calculations always use discounted values as this is a cost-effectiveness measure.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "openqaly"))
results <- run_model(model)

# Cumulative NMB over time
nmb_plot_line(results, "total_qalys", "total_cost", comparators = "control")

# Per-cycle NMB
nmb_plot_line(
  results, "total_qalys", "total_cost",
  interventions = "new_treatment", cumulative = FALSE
)
}
