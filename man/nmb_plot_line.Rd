\usage{
nmb_plot_line(
  res,
  health_outcome,
  cost_outcome,
  groups = "overall",
  wtp = NULL,
  interventions = NULL,
  comparators = NULL,
  time_unit = "cycle",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A heRomod2 model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{health_outcome}{Name of the health outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_outcome}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), specific group name, vector of groups, or NULL}

\item{wtp}{Optional override for willingness-to-pay. If NULL, extracts from outcome summary metadata.}

\item{time_unit}{Time unit for x-axis: "cycle" (default), "day", "week", "month", "year"}

\item{cumulative}{Logical. If TRUE (default), shows cumulative NMB over time.
If FALSE, shows per-cycle NMB.}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values?}

\item{intervention}{Single reference strategy for intervention perspective (e.g., "new_treatment").
If provided, shows intervention - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with comparator.}

\item{comparator}{Single reference strategy for comparator perspective (e.g., "control").
If provided, shows intervention - comparator comparisons. Mutually exclusive with intervention.}

\item{strategy_name_field}{Field to use for strategy names: "name" or "display_name"}

\item{group_name_field}{Field to use for group names: "name" or "display_name"}

\item{value_name_field}{Field to use for value names}

\item{summary_name_field}{Field to use for summary labels}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a line chart showing cumulative or per-cycle Net Monetary Benefit over time.
}
\details{
Either `intervention` or `comparator` must be specified (one is mandatory).
