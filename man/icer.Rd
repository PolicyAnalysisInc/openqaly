\title{Construct an ICER vector with custom printing}
\usage{
icer(dcost, deffect)
}
\arguments{
\item{dcost}{numeric vector of cost differences (intervention - comparator)}

\item{deffect}{numeric vector of outcome differences (intervention - comparator)}
}
\value{
An object of class "icer" (numeric under the hood) with this encoding:
  - More costly & more effective  :  +ICER (ΔC/ΔE)
  - Less costly & less effective  :  -ICER (negative whose opposite is ICER of comparator vs intervention)
  - Dominant (less costly, more effective OR same cost & more effective OR less costly & same effect): 0
  - Dominated (more costly, less effective OR ties that imply dominance against): Inf
  - Equivalent (same cost AND same effect): NaN
  - No comparison (reference strategy with NA deltas): NA (displays as blank)
