\usage{
trace_plot_area(
  res,
  groups = "overall",
  strategies = NULL,
  states = NULL,
  color_palette = NULL,
  show_legend = TRUE,
  collapsed = TRUE,
  use_display_names = TRUE,
  time_unit = "cycle"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A openqaly model results object (output from run_model)}

\item{groups}{Group selection: "overall" (default), specific group name,
vector of groups, "all" (all groups plus aggregated), "all_groups"
(all groups without overall), or NULL (same as "all")}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{states}{Character vector of states to include (NULL for all)}

\item{color_palette}{Named character vector of colors (names = state names),
or NULL to use default colors}

\item{show_legend}{Logical. Show legend?}

\item{collapsed}{Logical. Use aggregated traces (TRUE, default) or segment
traces (FALSE)}

\item{use_display_names}{Logical. If TRUE, use display names for entities}

\item{time_unit}{Time unit for output: "cycle" (default), "day", "week", "month", "year"}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
Creates a stacked area chart showing state occupancy over time.
This is the primary visualization for Markov trace data.
When multiple strategies or groups are present, they are automatically
faceted into separate panels.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "openqaly"))
results <- run_model(model)

# Basic stacked area plot (facets by strategy if multiple)
trace_plot_area(results)
}
