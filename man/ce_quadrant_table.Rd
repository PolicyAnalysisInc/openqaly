\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly PSA results object}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary}

\item{comparator}{Name of the comparator strategy}

\item{groups}{Group selection:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"overall"} - Overall population (aggregated, default)
  \item \code{"group_name"} - Specific group by name
  \item \code{c("group1", "group2")} - Multiple specific groups (no overall)
  \item \code{c("overall", "group1")} - Specific groups + overall
  \item \code{"all"} or \code{NULL} - All groups + overall
  \item \code{"all_groups"} - All groups without overall
}}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategies to include (NULL for all)}

\item{decimals}{Number of decimal places for percentages (default: 1)}

\item{font_size}{Font size for rendering (default: 11)}

\item{table_format}{Character. Backend to use: "flextable" (default) or "kable"}
}
\value{
A table object (flextable or kable depending on table_format)
}
\description{
Creates a table showing the percentage of PSA simulations falling into each
quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane relative to a comparator strategy.
}
\details{
The cost-effectiveness plane is divided into four quadrants:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{NE (Northeast)}: Costlier and more effective - trade-off region
  \item \strong{SE (Southeast)}: Cheaper and more effective - dominant
  \item \strong{SW (Southwest)}: Cheaper and less effective - trade-off region
  \item \strong{NW (Northwest)}: Costlier and less effective - dominated
}

CE quadrant calculations always use discounted values as this is a
cost-effectiveness measure.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- read_model(system.file("models/example_psm", package = "openqaly"))
psa_results <- run_psa(model, n_sim = 1000)

# CE quadrant probabilities relative to standard care
ce_quadrant_table(psa_results, "total_qalys", "total_cost",
                  comparator = "Standard Care")
}
