\usage{
get_psa_simulations(
  results,
  outcome_summary,
  cost_summary,
  group = "aggregated",
  strategies = NULL,
  discounted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly PSA results object (from run_psa)}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{group}{Group selection: "aggregated" (default) uses aggregated results,
specific group name filters to that group, NULL or "all" includes all groups
(triggers separate calculations per group)}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: simulation, strategy, group, cost, outcome
}
\description{
Helper function to extract simulation-level costs and outcomes from PSA results.
