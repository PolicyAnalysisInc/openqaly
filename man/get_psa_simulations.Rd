\usage{
get_psa_simulations(
  results,

  discounted = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A openqaly PSA results object (from run_psa)}

\item{outcome_summary}{Name of the outcome summary to use (e.g., "total_qalys")}

\item{cost_summary}{Name of the cost summary to use (e.g., "total_cost")}

\item{groups}{Group selection:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"overall"} - Overall population (aggregated, default)
  \item \code{"group_name"} - Specific group by name
  \item \code{c("group1", "group2")} - Multiple specific groups (no overall)
  \item \code{c("overall", "group1")} - Specific groups + overall
  \item \code{"all"} or \code{NULL} - All groups + overall
  \item \code{"all_groups"} - All groups without overall
}}

\item{strategies}{Character vector of strategy names to include (NULL for all)}

\item{discounted}{Logical. Use discounted values? (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
